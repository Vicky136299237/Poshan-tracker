# Poshan-tracker


I recently had the opportunity to deep dive into India's Poshan Tracker dataset, a crucial tool used to monitor nutritional and developmental services offered to women and children through the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme. This project aimed to convert raw public health data into meaningful insights that reveal regional disparities, infrastructure gaps, and program performance across states.

🔧 Tools & Technologies:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


✨ Project Highlights:

Efficiently cleaned and pre-processed large, real-world datasets

Conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Built impactful visualizations using:

Bar Charts to compare state-wise beneficiary coverage

Line Plots to track Aadhaar and Health ID trends

Histograms to examine data distribution

Donut & Pie Charts to present categorical proportions clearly



🎯 Key Focus Areas:

Participation Analysis: Tracked the reach of services among pregnant women, mothers, adolescents, and children

Health Monitoring: Studied the frequency of health check-ups (1–6 days, 7–14 days, etc.)

Infrastructure Assessment: Evaluated water, toilet, and building availability in Anganwadi centers

Operational Consistency: Assessed how often centers were functional (e.g., 1 vs. 21 days)

Digital Readiness: Analyzed Aadhaar and Health ID coverage to understand digital health adoption


🔍 Insights Uncovered:

State-level differences in program effectiveness and reach

Identified infrastructure shortfalls requiring urgent attention

Highlighted strong operational practices that can guide future policy decisions


🧠 What I Learned:

Working on this project sharpened my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling. Most importantly, it showed me the power of data science to influence public policy and uplift communities through better health and nutrition outcomes.
